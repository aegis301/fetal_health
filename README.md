# Info

This project is a simple implementation of machine learning on the fetal health classification dataset that can be found on kaggle.com [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification].

In this project, I will use machine learning to predict the fetal health by using features from cardiotocographic (CTG) data.

## How to Read

If you're interested in my work, you can go through the Fetal_Health.ipynb notebook. It contains a condensed version of my work on data exploration, feature selection, feature engineering and model training, as well as some work on data clustering. However, extensive clustering and deep learning are not (yet) implemented in this project.

## TL;DR
